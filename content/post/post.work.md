Work Experience
----------

**Backend Software Engineer, [Splice.com](https://splice.com/)**

:   Implementing features for and supporting customers of Splice API (internal
    and external).

**Software Engineer, [Perforce Software](https://www.perforce.com/)**

:   At Perforce, I worked as a Server Engineer on Helix Versioning Engine, which
    is Perforce's main versioning product. During my time at the company, I
    specialized in developing features for and supporting projects that were
    solving a variety of problems around bi-directional Perforce <-> Git
    integration.

    * Git Fusion, a tool used for translating Git repo history into Perforce
      file-based history format
    * GraphDepot, a subset of Perforce Server features around storing Git
      history natively in Perforce
    * GitConnector, a tool used for mirroring Git projects between 3rd party
      providers (GitHub, GitLab, etc) and GraphDepot

Other Experience
--------------------

Technical Reviewer, O'Reilly Media
:   Reviewed Docker books for technical accuracy, organization, flow and clarity

    * [Docker Up & Running](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920036142.do)
    * [Using Docker](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920035671.do)
    * [Docker Cookbook](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920036791.do)

Programming Languages
:   **Go:** Currently I primarily code in Go. Go is beautiful, compiles
    fast, portable, has an incredible feature support in base libraries, and
    obsoletes many style-related discussions üíñ

:   **C++:** The Perforce Server is written in C++, so I worked on maintaining
    and developing features in a 20-year old codebase, as well as brand-new
    projects ü§ñ

:   **Python:** Python was the first programming language I learned, it was also
    the programming language used for the Git Fusion project at Perforce. I
    still hold it very dear in my heart üêç

:   **Perl:** Ask me about my opinions on Perl some other time, but I wrote it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
